					</div>

					<div class="terms-text">
						<h3>Virtual Consultations</h3>
						<p>You acknowledge that a virtual consultation may not be the appropriate course of treatment for your particular healthcare needs. Medical services rendered by a Provider are subject to their professional judgment. Any information or advice received from a Provider comes from the individual Provider. You and your individual Provider are solely responsible for all information and/or communication sent during a virtual consultation or other Clinical Services communication. </p>
						<p>Virtual consultations with Providers are not intended to replace your relationship with your existing primary care physician and are not a substitute for regular use of your primary care physician. Virtual consultations cannot be used for any service that must be provided to you by your regular physician as an in-office follow up to an in-office visit, at no additional charge to you or your health care plan, as required by your health care plan.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="terms-text">
						<h3>Medical Records</h3>
						<p>Any clinical information provided as part of a virtual consultation becomes part of your legal medical record. Virtual consultations are provided in real-time. Accordingly, no audio or video recordings are maintained or stored in your legal medical record. You agree to provide accurate information about yourself for your legal medical record. Use of your legal medical record by your Provider is governed by our Notice of Privacy Practices. It is your responsibility to confirm any third party information, or information regarding a minor child of whom you are a parent or legal guardian, in your medical record. </p>
					</div>

					<div class="terms-text">
						<h3>Prescriptions</h3>
						<p>Any prescriptions ordered by Providers are subject to state regulations and prescriptions may not be available in your state. In the event that a Provider does prescribe a medication, he/she will limit the supply based on state regulations and will only prescribe a medication, as determined appropriate in his/her sole discretion and professional judgment. There is no guarantee that a prescription will be written.</p>
						<p>Any prescriptions that you acquire from a Provider shall be solely for your personal use. You should fully and carefully read all provided product information and labels and contact a physician or pharmacist if you have any questions regarding any prescription that you acquire from a Provider.</p>

						<h3>About the Digital Health Tools</h3>
						<p>The Digital Health Tools in the CallGPNow App may include Symptom Checker (also referred to as Chatbot), Healthcheck, Health Assessment, and/or Monitor. Symptom Checker (also referred to as Chatbot) is a symptom checker that provides information about possible matching conditions based on the symptoms you input. Healthcheck generates a “digital twin” and report based on information you input compared with general statistical information and risk factors, and provides wellness tips and health insights for a healthy lifestyle. Health Assessment is a data collection tool used to assist CallGPNow Care Advisors in gathering information needed to optimize your healthcare experience. Monitor contains features that can help you achieve and sustain a positive mental outlook and healthier lifestyle by self-tracking your mood, activity, and other wellness indicators. You are responsible for reviewing the support materials in the Me tab prior to using the Digital Health Tools to assess whether the Digital Health Tools are suitable for your health information needs.</p>
						<p>You may be able to access certain additional Digital Health Tools through the CallGPNow app related to COVID-19.</p>
						<p>Monitor provides information about COVID-19 to help you understand when you might need medical advice, and provides tips to help you look after yourself.</p>
						<p>If you sign up for a COVID-19 Care Plan, you can track your symptoms in Monitor and receive reminders and self-care information. If you sign up for a Care Plan, you accept the risk of electronic protected health information (ephi) being communicated to you via email.</p>
						<p>Live Chat, if available, allows you to chat with a support agent who can answer general, non-medical questions you have about COVID-19 and help you make decisions about seeking appropriate medical care.</p>
						<p>Information provided by these additional COVID-19 Digital Health Tools is sourced from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization, and available practice guidelines.</p>
						<p>Monitor may also provide access to a Mood Tracker, which allows you to self-track your mood over time. It is not monitored by a clinician and is not intended to be used for diagnostic or treatment purposes.</p>
						<p>Additionally, Monitor may provide you with the option of setting up push notification medication reminders for yourself, to help you remember to take your medication(s). If you set up medication reminders, you accept the risk of receiving unencrypted health information, which could be seen by others. If you use this feature, you are solely responsible for taking your medication(s) according to the prescribed dose and frequency, and you agree that we shall not be liable for any outcome in connection with your use of and reliance on medication reminders.</p>
