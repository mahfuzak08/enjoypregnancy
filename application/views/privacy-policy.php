						<p>At CallGPNow Inc. (“CallGPNow”, “we”, “our”, and “us”), we respect your privacy and appreciate the trust you have placed in us. This Privacy Policy explains how CallGPNow collects, uses, and discloses information we obtain in connection with our provision of services through the websites, mobile applications, or other online services that link to or refer to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Services”), except with respect to individually identifiable health information that is considered Protected Health Information (“PHI”) under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended. Information about uses and disclosures of your PHI is covered by the Notice of Privacy Practices of the covered entity providing telemedicine services to you through the CallGPNow App. That Notice of Privacy Practices is also available through the "Me" tab in the CallGPNow App.</p>
						<p>It is important that you read this Privacy Policy carefully because any time you use our Services, you consent, on your own behalf and/or on behalf of your minor dependent(s), to the practices we describe in this Privacy Policy.</p>

						<h4>Information We Collect Automatically</h4>
						<p>We may automatically collect certain technical information from your computer or mobile device when you use the Services.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Device and Usage Information. We may receive information from your device, including the IP address, mobile operating system version, and unique device identifiers. We may also collect and store your browser and app settings and preferences. </li>
							<li>Online Activity. We may receive information about your interactions with our Services and other electronic and network activity information, such as the time spent interacting with content and the dates and times of your visits, and other information through the use of cookies, web beacons, and other Internet technologies:<br>
							<ul>
								<li>Cookies. Cookies are pieces of information that are stored by your browser on the hard drive or memory of your computer or other Internet access device. Cookies may enable us to personalize your experience on the Services, maintain a persistent session, passively collect demographic information about your computer, and monitor other activities. Please consult your browser and app settings for information about the choices you may have to disable or limit cookies.</li>
								<li>Web Beacons. Web beacons and similar technologies are small bits of code, which are embedded in web pages, ads, and e-mail, that communicate with third parties. We may use web beacons, for example, to count the number of users who have visited a particular web page, to deliver or communicate with cookies, and to understand usage patterns.</li>
								<li>Other Internet Technologies. Our Website and mobile applications may use local stored objects (also referred to as “Flash cookies”) and other types of local storage (such as browser-based or plugin-based local storage) that can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences across different services and sessions. Please note that these technologies are distinct from browser-based cookies, and you may not be able to control them using standard browser tools and settings.</li>
							</ul>

						</ul>
					</div>

					<div class="terms-text">
						<h4>How we use your information</h4>
						<p>We generally use the information we collect for the following business purposes:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Provide, customize and improve our products and services. For example, we use the information we collect about you to provide the Services, to improve and develop new products, services, features, and functionality, and to understand and analyze the usage trends and preferences of our users.

							<li>Otherwise with your consent or as described to you at the time of collection.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="terms-text">
						<h4>Third parties with whom we share your information</h4> 
						<ul>
							<li>Affiliates. Information you provide and information we collect automatically may be shared among Affiliated Companies for the purposes described in the previous section of this Privacy Policy. “Affiliated Companies” refers to companies related by common ownership or control or who make their clinical services available through the CallGPNow App.</li>
							<li>Service Providers. We work with third party service providers who provide development, hosting, and other services. These third parties may have access to or process information you provide and information we collect automatically in connection with providing us these services.</li>
							<li>Business Transfers. We also reserve the right to transfer information you provide and information we collect automatically to advisors, potential transactional partners, or other third parties in connection with the consideration, negotiation, or completion of a corporate transaction in which we are acquired by or merged with another company or we sell, liquidate, or transfer all or a portion of our assets, or in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy.</li>
							<li>Other Parties As Required by Law or As Necessary. We may disclose information you provide and information we collect automatically about you: (i) if we are required to do so by law, regulation, or legal process, such as a court order or subpoena; (ii) in response to requests by government agencies, such as law enforcement authorities; (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect against or respond to physical, financial or other harm, injury, or loss to property; or (iv) in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual unlawful activity.</li>
							<li>With Your Consent. We may share information you provide and information we collect automatically for other purposes with your consent or at your direction.</li>							
						</ul>
						<p>We also may use or make available to third parties information you provide and information we collect automatically in a manner that does not identify you or has been aggregated. For example, we may share aggregated information with third parties that sponsor usage of the Services. </p>
					</div>
					<div class="terms-text">
						<h4>Third-party services</h4>
						<p>The Services may link to or otherwise provide access to websites or other services provided by third parties. Any information you provide on third-party websites or services is provided directly to the operators of such services and is subject to those operators’ policies, if any, governing privacy and security, even if accessed through the Services. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of third-party sites or services to which links or access are provided through the Services. We encourage you to learn about third parties’ privacy and security policies before providing them with information.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="terms-text">
						<h4>Third-party advertising, links and content</h4>
						<p>We allow third parties, including business partners, advertising networks, and other advertising service providers, to collect your information through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies on the Services. This information may be collected over time and combined with information collected across different online services. For example, Braze technology has been integrated into the Services. Braze technology will automatically track certain usage metrics involved with your use of the Services (such as when you first used the Services and when you last used them, and the total number of sessions you have had on that Services). A detailed list of what information is automatically captured by the Braze technology: See what information Braze collects.</p>
						<p>These third parties may use this information to deliver advertisements in the Services and elsewhere tailored to your interests, preferences, and characteristics. You may be able to opt out of this interest-based advertising through your device settings or mobile app permissions. In addition, some of these companies participate in industry-developed programs designed to provide consumers choices about whether to receive targeted advertising. Please visit the websites operated by the Network Advertising Initiative and Digital Advertising Alliance to learn more.</p>
						<p>Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms. Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites with which the user communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, the Services currently do not take action in response to these signals. If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="terms-text">
						<h4>Your choices and rights</h4>
						<p>You may, of course, decline to share certain information with us, in which case we may not be able to provide to you some of the features and functionality of the Services. If you wish to exercise any legal rights you may have to access or amend any personal information we hold about you, you may contact us at contact@callgpnow.com. </p>
					</div>

					<div class="terms-text">
						<h4>How we hold and protect your information</h4>
						<p>We use certain physical, administrative, and technical measures that are intended to maintain the integrity and security of information that we collect and maintain. We encrypt your data when it is stored, and store it in secure facilities. Except when it is not possible, your data is encrypted in transit. We strictly control access to the personal information we collect about you. Please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot and do not guarantee that information about you will not be accessed, viewed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. Moreover, CallGPNow cannot guarantee the security of networks that we do not control, including the Internet and any wireless networks over which information may be transmitted to CallGPNow.</p>

					<div class="terms-text">
						<h4>International users</h4>
						<p>The Services are intended for users located within the United States. If you choose to use the Services from the European Union or other regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, then please note that you may be transferring your personal information outside of those regions to the United States for storage and processing. Also, we may transfer your data from the U.S. to other countries or regions. By providing any information, including personal information, on or to the Services, you consent to such transfer, storage, and processing.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="terms-text">
						<h4>Changes to our privacy policy and practices</h4>
						<p>This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically and without prior notice to you to reflect changes in our information practices or relevant laws.
